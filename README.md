# GapNavigator: LiDAR-Based Autonomous Path Follower

GapNavigator is an **autonomous navigation system** that uses LiDAR to detect gaps in obstacles and follow optimal paths in dynamic environments. The system enables safe, precise, and efficient movement by implementing real-time gap detection and steering control algorithms.

## Features

- LiDAR-based gap detection for obstacle avoidance  
- Midpoint-based steering strategy for precise navigation  
- Ackermann steering control for smooth and stable motion  
- Real-time path following in dynamic and complex environments  
- Visualization of detected gaps and navigation paths using ROS markers
